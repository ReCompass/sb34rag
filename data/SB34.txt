legislative counsel’s digest
SB 34, Wiener. Cannabis: donations.
(1) The Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA),
an initiative measure approved as Proposition 64 at the November 8, 2016,
statewide general election, authorizes a person who obtains a state license
under AUMA to engage in commercial adult-use cannabis activity pursuant
to that license and applicable local ordinances. The Medicinal and Adult-Use
Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), among other things,
consolidates the licensure and regulation of commercial medicinal and
adult-use cannabis activities.
Existing administrative law prohibits a retailer licensee from providing
free cannabis goods to any person or allowing individuals who are not
employed by the retailer to provide free cannabis goods to any person on
the licensed premises. Existing administrative law provides an exception
to this prohibition for specified medicinal retailer and microbusiness
licensees to provide access to medicinal cannabis patients who have difficulty
accessing medicinal cannabis goods, as specified.
This bill, the Dennis Peron and Brownie Mary Act, would similarly
authorize, on and after a specified date, licensees that are authorized to make
retail sales to provide free cannabis or cannabis products to a medicinal
cannabis patient or the patient’s primary caregiver if specified requirements
are met, including that the cannabis or cannabis products otherwise meet
specified requirements of MAUCRSA. The bill would authorize those
licensees to contract with an individual or organization to coordinate the
provision of free medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products on
the retailer’s premises.
(2) Existing law deems information contained in a physician’s
recommendation to use cannabis for medical purposes to be “medical
information” within the meaning of the Confidentiality of Medical
Information Act, and prohibits a licensee from disclosing this information
except, among other exceptions, as necessary for the state or any city, county,
or city and county to perform certain official duties. Existing law, the
Medical Marijuana Program (MMP), requires counties to administer an
91
identification card program for qualified patients that possess or cultivate
cannabis for personal medical purposes. Existing law deems identification
cards issued to those qualified patients to be “medical information” within
the meaning of the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, and likewise
prohibits a licensee from disclosing these identification cards, subject to the
same exceptions.
This bill would additionally except from these prohibitions against
disclosure the disclosure of the medical information described above as
necessary for the state or any city, county, or city and county to perform
official duties pursuant to the Sales and Use Tax Law and pursuant to
provisions relating to cannabis taxes.
(3) Existing sales and use tax laws impose use taxes on the storage, use,
or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased
from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state, presumes
tangible personal property purchased outside the state that is stored, used,
or consumed in this state is purchased for use in this state, and provides
various exemptions from those taxes.
This bill, on and after a specified operative date, and until 5 years after
that operative date, would exempt from the use tax the storage, use, or other
consumption in this state of medicinal cannabis or medicinal cannabis
products that are donated, for no consideration, under specified
circumstances. The bill would require the exemption to apply only if the
cannabis retailer certifies in writing, as specified, that the medicinal cannabis
or medicinal cannabis product will be used as specified. The bill would
make a licensee that uses the donated medicinal cannabis or medicinal
cannabis product in some other manner, or for some other purpose, liable
for the payment of use tax and subject to having their license suspended.
The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes
counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with
the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing laws authorize districts, as specified,
to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions
and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law.
Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated
into the local tax laws.
Existing law requires the state to reimburse counties and cities for revenue
losses caused by the enactment of sales and use tax exemptions.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue
and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not
reimburse any local agencies for sales and use tax revenues lost by them
pursuant to this bill.
(4) AUMA imposes an excise tax on the purchase of cannabis and
cannabis products, as defined, at the rate of 15% of the average market price
of any retail sale by a cannabis retailer.
The bill would require that these provisions not be construed to impose
an excise tax upon medicinal cannabis, or medicinal cannabis products,
donated for no consideration to a medicinal cannabis patient, as specified.
91
— 2 —Ch. 837
(5) AUMA imposes a cultivation tax on all harvested cannabis that enters
the commercial market upon all cultivators. Existing law defines entering
the commercial market to mean cannabis or cannabis products, except for
immature cannabis plants and seeds, that complete and comply with specified
quality assurance review and testing.
This bill, on and after a specified operative date, and until 5 years after
that operative date, would prohibit the cultivation tax from being imposed
on medicinal cannabis designated for donation by a cultivator in the track
and trace system. The bill would require a licensee that certifies in writing
that the medicinal cannabis or a medicinal cannabis product will be donated
to a medicinal cannabis patient and sells or uses the medicinal cannabis or
medicinal cannabis product in some manner or for some purpose other than
donation be liable for the cultivation tax. By expanding the scope of the
crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would specify that the certification in writing relieves the cultivator
that donates the medicinal cannabis from liability for the cultivation tax and
the distributor from liability for collecting the cultivation only if the
certification is taken in good faith. The bill would prohibit a distributor from
collecting or remitting the cultivation tax for medicinal cannabis or medicinal
cannabis products designated for donation by the cultivator. The bill would
require a cultivator to keep records of any medicinal cannabis or medicinal
cannabis products designated for donation. The bill would require that the
cannabis tax provisions not be construed to impose a cultivation tax upon
medicinal cannabis or medicinal cannabis products designated for donation
by a cultivator.
(6) The bill would require the Legislative Analyst’s Office, in order to
enable the Legislature to determine whether the use tax exemption and the
cultivation tax exemption provided by the bill are meeting, failing to meet,
or exceeding a specified goal and objective, to collect certain data regarding
the tax exemptions from specified entities, and to submit a report containing
the data to the Legislature and the Governor annually each year that the tax
exemptions are in effect.
(7) This bill would provide that the provisions of the act are severable.
(8) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 26001 of
the Business and Professions Code proposed by SB 185 to be operative only
if this bill and SB 185 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
(9) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local
agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory
provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for
a specified reason.
(10) The Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act, an
initiative measure, authorizes the Legislature to amend the act to further the
purposes and intent of the act with a 2⁄3 vote of the membership of both
houses of the Legislature, except as provided.
This bill would declare that its provisions further specified purposes and
intent of the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act.

SEC. 13. It is the intent of the Legislature to apply the requirements of
Section 41 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to this act. Therefore, the
91

Legislature finds and declares the following with respect to the tax
exemptions provided by Section 6414 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,
as added by Section 7 of this act, and Section 34012.1 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, as added by Section 11 of this act:
(a) The goal and objective of the tax exemptions provided by Section
6414 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, as added by Section 7 of this act,
and Section 34012.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, as added by Section
11 of this act, is to eliminate the tax burden placed on charitable cannabis
donations to medicinal cannabis patients in order to minimize the need for
those patients to turn to the illicit market in the state. By providing tax
exemptions for medicinal cannabis products that are donated to medicinal
cannabis patients, this act is intended to offset other financial burdens that
cannabis licensees face that bar them from donating cannabis to medicinal
cannabis patients who are unable to afford and access safe and tested
cannabis in the legal market.
(b) In order to enable the Legislature to determine whether the tax
exemptions provided by Section 6414 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,

Taxation Code, as added by Section 11 of this act, are meeting, failing to
meet, or exceeding the goal and objective specified in subdivision (a), the

Department of Food and Agriculture shall make any information requested
pursuant to this subdivision available to the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
The Legislative Analyst’s Office shall submit an annual report containing

operative, and as of that date is repealed.

provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application.

both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2020,
(2) each bill amends Section 26001 of the Business and Professions Code,
and (3) this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 185, in which case Section 3 of
this bill shall not become operative.
SEC. 16. Notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse
any local agency for any sales and use tax revenues lost by it under this act.
SEC. 17. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section
6 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution because the only costs that
may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because
this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction,
or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of
Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime
within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California
Constitution.
SEC. 18. The Legislature finds and declares that this act is consistent
with, and furthers the purposes and intent of, the Control, Regulate and Tax
Adult Use of Marijuana Act, as stated in Section 3 of that act, by allowing
indigent medicinal cannabis patients to continue to receive donated cannabis
for medicinal personal use.
