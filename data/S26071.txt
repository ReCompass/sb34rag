BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE
Section 26071
26071. (a) To provide access to medicinal cannabis patients who have difficulty
accessing cannabis or cannabis products, a licensee that is authorized to make retail
sales may provide free cannabis or cannabis products if all of the following criteria
are met:
(1) Free cannabis or cannabis products are provided only to a medicinal cannabis
patient or the patient’s primary caregiver. For purposes of this section, “medicinal
cannabis patient” includes a qualified patient, as defined under Section 11362.7 of
the Health and Safety Code, or a person in possession of a valid identification card
issued under Section 11362.71 of the Health and Safety Code.
(2) (A) A licensed retailer providing medicinal cannabis or medicinal cannabis
products pursuant to this section to a qualified patient, as defined under Section
11362.7 of the Health and Safety Code, that possesses a valid physician’s
recommendation, shall ensure that the physician is in good standing by following the
procedures described in subparagraph (B) before providing the qualified patient with
any medicinal cannabis or medicinal cannabis products that a cultivator certified were
for donation pursuant to Section 34012.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code or that
are exempt from the use tax pursuant to Section 6414 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code.
(B) In order to verify the physician’s recommendation, the licensed retailer shall
do all of the following:
(i) Verify with the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board
of California, and the California Board of Podiatric Medicine that the attending
physician has a license in good standing to practice medicine or osteopathy in the
state.
(ii) Keep a copy of the patient’s or primary caregiver’s driver’s license or other
government issued identification.
(3) Except as provided for under Section 34012.1 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, the cannabis or cannabis products comply with all applicable requirements for
cultivation, manufacture, distribution, processing, storing, laboratory testing,
packaging, labeling, transportation, delivery, or donation under this division.
(4) A licensee intending to donate the cannabis or cannabis products shall designate
the cannabis or cannabis products for donation in the track and trace system. If a
cultivator certified that the cannabis or cannabis products are designated for donation
to medicinal cannabis patients pursuant to Section 34012.1 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, a licensee shall not change that designation pursuant to subdivision
(b) of Section 34012.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(5) Before being provided to the patient or primary caregiver, the cannabis or
cannabis products have been properly recorded in the track and trace system as
belonging to the retailer.
(6) The cannabis or cannabis products provided to a medicinal cannabis patient
or the primary caregiver of the patient in a single day shall not exceed the possession
limits prescribed by Section 11362.77 of the Health and Safety Code.
(7) The event shall be properly recorded in the retailer’s inventory records and the
track and trace system. The retailer shall include in its inventory records for each
medicinal cannabis patient the number of an identification card issued pursuant to
Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 11362.7) of Chapter 6 of Division 10 of the
Health and Safety Code or a copy of the physician’s recommendation for no less than
four years. If the medicinal cannabis patient is a qualified patient, as defined under
Section 11362.7 of the Health and Safety Code, that possesses a valid physician’s
recommendation, the retailer shall certify in writing that they verified the
recommendation pursuant to paragraph (2) and shall keep a copy of that certification
for no less than seven years.
(8) A licensed retailer that donates medicinal cannabis or medicinal cannabis
products shall note the donation in their sales invoice or receipt pursuant to Section
26161 of the Business and Professions Code.
(b) In addition to the provision of free cannabis or cannabis products in subdivision
(a), a licensee that is authorized to make retail sales may donate cannabis or cannabis
products and the use of equipment in compliance with any compassionate use, equity,
or other similar program administered by a local jurisdiction.
(c) A licensee that is authorized to make retail sales may contract with an individual
or organization to coordinate the provision of free medicinal cannabis or medicinal
cannabis products on the retailer’s premises. Licensed retailers that are solely
authorized to engage in retail sales by means of delivery may provide free medicinal
cannabis or medicinal cannabis products by means of delivery.
(d) This section shall become operative upon completion of the necessary changes
to the track and trace program in order to implement the act adding this section, as
determined by the Department of Food and Agriculture, or on March 1, 2020,
whichever occurs first.
